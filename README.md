# Walgreens Vaccine Bot

This jupyter notebook was built with the intention of monitoring the walgreens website and notifying me of a vaccine becoming available.

It handles email verification codes and sends an email when it realizes something is available.

Ultimately it became challenging to evade bot detection. Tried using mitm proxy found via some online tuts to try and bypass it. 

Funny enough, it seems opening the tab in a new private window helped when trying to visit the site manually and being denied access. 

If you fork this or try to modify the code I would suggest doing that amonst other bot evasion techniques.
